  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am primarily working with Angular and Symfony and currently studying
    computer-science at the FOM-Hochschule in DÃ¼sseldorf.
  </p>
  <p>
    At work I develop highly complex configurators for our customers, which let
    users configure products to their individual needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my freetime I like to learn more about coding and try to improve myself
    towards writing clean, correct and performant code. Right now this includes
    using Rust for learning language design and compilation. As well as
    experimenting with tools for easier testing in Angular.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are the technologies, I would consider myself most comfortable with:
  </p>
  <ul class="skills">
    {
      skills.map((skill) => (
        <li>
          <img
            src={`/images/logos/${skill}.webp`}
            width="128"
            height="128"
            loading="lazy"
            alt={skill}
          />
        </li>
      ))
    }
  </ul>
