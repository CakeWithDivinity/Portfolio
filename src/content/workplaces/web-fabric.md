I worked as a software engineering trainee at web fabric GmbH in
Wuppertal for 3 days a week while I visited a university the rest of the week.
At work, we developed complex configurators, shops and other custom solutions
for our customers. My typical day at work contained the following activities:

- Implementing new features in the front- or backend of product configuration platforms using our Techstack (Angular, Symfony and Postgres)
- Reviewing Angular code of my coworkers and assissting them in writing
  performant and reactive code
- Maintaining an internal framework to handle rendering and change-processing
  of forms with several hundred fields and options
- Improving the requirements engineering workflow at our company
