I have been working as a software engineer at dynabase since 2023.
So far I have been working on several projects ranging from SaaS to product configurators.
Most of the time I am involved in one of the following activities:

- Implementing and maintaining several product configurators for one of our customers:
  - Running data imports from the companies product database
  - Programming configurator logic and physical formulas for calculating the validity and lifetime of available products
  - Maintenance of an internal framework to standardize the development of configurators across multiple teams
- Working on new features and bugfixes for a SaaS product:
  - Programming of a scalable web crawler and scraper, which extracts product information
    from e-commerce sites
  - Configuration of a text embedding pipeline for products to implement a semantic search
    for online shops
  - Implementation of a retrieval-augmented-generation system to assist customers in finding
    the right product for their needs
