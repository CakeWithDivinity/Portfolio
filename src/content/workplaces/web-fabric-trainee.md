I worked as a software engineering trainee at Web-Fabric GmbH in
Wuppertal for 3 days a week, while I visited a university the rest of the week.
At work, we developed complex configurators, shops and other custom solutions
for our customers. My typical day at work contained the following activities:

-   Implementing new features in the front- or backend using our Techstack
    (Angular, Symfony and Postgres)
-   Reviewing Angular code of my coworkers and assissting them in writing
    performant and reactive code
-   Maintaining an internal framework to handle rendering and change-processing
    of forms with several hundred fields and options
-   Improving the Requirements-Engineering workflow at our company
