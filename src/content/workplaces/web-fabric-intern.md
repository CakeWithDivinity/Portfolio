After a 2 week long internship, which we had to do in order to get our degree,
I got a job offer from Web-Fabric GmbH. I convinced them of the knowledge in
programming, which I gained by doing software-engineering as a hobby since I
was ten years old. In the first year I had a mentor on my side, supervising
my rewrite of an existing API in ASP.NET Core.
While, in the second year, I got to develop implementations of an internal
framework as sample-applications, so other developers on our team could
understand and use the library more easily.
